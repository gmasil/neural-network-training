The following guides helped me to understand the mathematics behind neural networks:
* https://realpython.com/python-ai-neural-network/
* https://towardsdatascience.com/math-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-d6da9f29ce65

The first article enabled me to create a neural network with two neurons. The second one from [OmarAflak](https://github.com/OmarAflak) helped me to understand how to expand the network to more neurons and layers. I ended up using his code for the network as it was so easy to read and use.
